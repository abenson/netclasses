			<p>
				netclasses is an easy to use, unbloated API for handling 
				asynchronous connections in Objective-C under GNUstep as
				well as OS X.  It can also be used for synchronous connections
				but this is -not- its primary use.
			</p>
			<p>
				Please also refer to <uref url="rfc1459.txt">RFC 1459</uref>
				as a supplement to the IRC portion of this documentation.
