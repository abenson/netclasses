===============================================================================

Compiling:
    Typing 'make' will compile a sample tool that uses the classes.
 
Installing:
    There is nothing to install.

Documentation:
    Documentation/netclasses.gsdoc is the documentation.  To make a html
    file out of it, simply type 'make'

Use:
    Feel free to use the four files in Source/ in a GNUstep project.  They will
    allow a server app to be easily set up.  Since the distribution is so small
    I opted to do it this way instead of setting up an entire library.  Simply
    add these files into any project, follow the example, read the
    docs and have fun.
