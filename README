**** Please see README.osx for instructions dealing with OSX compilation ****



==========
Compiling:
==========
	./configure
	make
	make install

	One note about ./configure, I am not using it for makefiles, so the 
	--prefix and other flags will have -no- effect on the output.  It is
	only used to check for various types and headers.

======================
Environment Variables:
======================
	GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DIR
		Determines the root of where netclasses and its documentation
		will be installed.  This is generally /usr/GNUstep/Local but
		can be reassigned to other targets such as 
		GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DIR=$GNUSTEP_USER_ROOT
		to install into a user's home directory.

==============
Documentation:
==============
    Documentation/ holds the netclasses documentation.  This documentation
	will not be compiled and installed with netclasses.  This must be done
	separately.  Simply type make followed by make install in the 
	Documentation/ directory to build and install the documentation.  The 
	resulting documentation will end up in:
	
	$(GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DIR)/Library/Documentation/Developer/netclasses

	This documentation has a brief overview of netclasses as well as the 
	class references.

====
Use:
====
	Simply link to the framework after it is installed in your application.

	See the Examples/ directory for examples of the use of netclasses.

	testsuite/ contains various tests to examine the extent to which things 
	work on other operating systems or other architectures.

	and suggestions to help make netclasses what it is.
