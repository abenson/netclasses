First off, let me say that since I do not own and never have owned a Mac 
I have absolutely no way to actually maintain proper building methods on 
OSX.  Therefore, building on OSX will be limited to gnustep-make style
compilations.

Secondly, if you cannot understand the instructions herein, please download
the binaries rather than wasting my time with issues related to lack of skill
with unix-like systems and the command line environment.  The binaries are
the recommended way of dealing with netclasses on OS X.  You have been warned.

****


Step 1: 
	Download gnustep-make from http://www.gnustep.org.  You do not need
	gnustep-base or gnustep-gui; all you need is gnustep-make.  Read the
	included documentation and proceed with its installation.

Step 2:
	Set GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DIR to the root directory that you wish to install
	to.  All directories will be based off this root directory.  If you wish
	to install into the standard location for frameworks, you probably want
	GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DIR=/.  If you do not have administrator rights, you
	will need to use GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DIR=$HOME

Step 3:
	Type make followed by make install.  netclasses should be installed.  
	You will not be able to build the documentation without gnustep-base
	installed.  It is recommended to download the documentation off the
	website (http://aeruder.gnustep.us).

Example:
	The following commands will work in most cases:
		GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DIR=/ make install
	or
		GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DIR=$HOME make install
	
Conclusion:
	Have fun!  If you got through this successfully you are ready to start
	developing with netclasses.  If you didn't, just give in already and
	get the binaries!  I already went through the pain of getting them to
	compile so you don't have to.
